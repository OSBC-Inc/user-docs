# Secure Kubernetes workloads on OKE

### What is OKE?

Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) is an Oracle-managed container orchestration service that can reduce the time and cost to build modern cloud native applications. Unlike most other vendors, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides Container Engine for Kubernetes as a free service that runs on higher-performance, lower-cost compute shapes. DevOps engineers can use unmodified, open source Kubernetes for application workload portability and to simplify operations with automatic updates and patching. Learn more about OKE [here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/).

### What will you learn?

In this tutorial, you will learn how to quickly deploy and scan Kubernetes workloads running on OKE with Snyk to find vulnerabilities in your open source dependencies, container images, and application misconfigurations.
