# Secure Kubernetes workloads on GKE Autopilot

### What is GKE Autopilot?

Autopilot is a new _mode of operation_ in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) that is designed to reduce the operational cost of managing clusters, optimize your clusters for production, and yield higher workload availability. You can learn more about Autopilot [here.](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview)

### What will you learn?

In this tutorial, you will learn how to quickly deploy and scan Kubernetes workloads running on GKE Autopilot with Snyk to find vulnerabilities in your open source dependencies, container images, and application misconfigurations.
