# Exercise - Fixing the Vulnerability

According to the fix advice, we need to fix the `PrimeFaces` dependency and update it from version `6.1` to `6.2`.

Let us pretend the developer fixed it and checked it in, coming back into the pipeline. This is done by changing.

`~/environment/aws-modernization-workshop/modules/containerize-application/app/pom.xml`

_Changing:_

```
<version.primefaces>6.1</version.primefaces>
```

_To:_

```
<version.primefaces>6.2</version.primefaces>
```

Run this command to copy over our fixed version in the lab:

```
cp modules/snyk/pom.xml modules/containerize-application/app/
```

_Save changes:_

```
git commit -am "Fix vulnerable open source dep."
```

_Push:_

```
git push -f codecommit master
```

This time check `Code Builder` and we see it succeeded.

```
Tested 37 dependencies for known vulnerabilities, no vulnerable paths found.
Next steps:
- Run `snyk monitor` to be notified about new related vulnerabilities.
```

The vulnerability is fixed and the build succeeded!

Next, we also see **Snyk** successfully scanned the `Docker Image` and there were no package dependency issues with our Docker container!
