# Initial Setup

You'll need accounts on Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud and Snyk to do this workshop.

We'll start with the Atlassian Bitbucket Account.  Please see our [documentation ](../../../getting-started/atlassian-integrations/atlassian-bitbucket-account.md)to get a trial account if you don't already have one.  Otherwise, you can use an existing account.  In addition to having a Bitbucket account, you need permissions to perform these tasks in Bitbucket:

* Enable App Passwords
* Add/Import a repository
* Enable Pipelines
* Add Repository variables

Next, you will need a Snyk account on snyk.io.  The [Snyk documentation](../../../getting-started/snyk-integrations/snyk-account.md) describes how you can get an account on the free tier.  Module 1 works with the free tier.

The permissions you need in your Snyk account are to import a repository.

Once you have these two accounts, we can move onto importing a sample repository.
