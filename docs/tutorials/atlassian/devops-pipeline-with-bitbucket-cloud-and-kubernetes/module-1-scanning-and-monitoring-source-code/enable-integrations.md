# Enable integrations

Once you have imported a repository into Bitbucket, the next step is to configure the integration between Snyk and Bitbucket.  This is a one-time setup operation for the first repository.

First, ensure you follow the instructions to setup an [atlassian-bitbucket-app-password.md](../../../getting-started/atlassian-integrations/atlassian-bitbucket-app-password.md "mention").  This App password is required for authentication between Snyk and Atlassian.  You'll use the app password in the next step.

The second step is to use the App Password to configure the [snyk-atlassian-bitbucket-integration.md](../../../getting-started/atlassian-integrations/snyk-atlassian-bitbucket-integration.md "mention") and add your repository.

These two steps connect Snyk and Atlassian Bitbucket so we can automatically scan your repository with Snyk and display results within Bitbucket.

The next part reviews results.
