# Atlassian Jira

The [Atlassian Jira + Snyk integration](https://www.atlassian.com/solutions/devops/integrations/snyk) enables users to raise Jira issues within Snyk for vulnerabilities and license issues. This page describes how to setup the integration.

You'll need an Atlassian Jira account. If you don't have one, follow the instructions from the [Atlassian Site](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) to try it free. If you do have a Jira account, you will need permissions to perform the following activities:

* Create an Atlassian API token
* Permission to Browse Projects
* Permission to Create Issues

The [Snyk Docs page ](https://docs.snyk.io/features/integrations/notifications-ticketing-system-integrations/jira)describes how to setup the Atlassian Jira integration.

When you have successfully integrated with Jira, you get the ability to raise an issue directly from a vulnerability with a button as shown below:

The Snyk Docs contain additional details about the integration.
