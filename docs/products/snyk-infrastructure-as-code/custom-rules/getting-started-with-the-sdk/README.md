# Getting started with the SDK

To get you started with the SDK, you will learn how to:

1. [Parse a fixture file](parsing-an-input-file.md) in order to help you understand how to write a rule
2. [​Write a rule with the SDK](writing-a-rule.md) using Rego
3. [Add unit tests for the rules you’ve written](testing-a-rule.md) to verify your rules
4. [Build a bundle containing your custom rules](bundling-rules.md) so that you can [use it with the Snyk CLI](../use-IaC-custom-rules-with-CLI/)
5. [Push the bundle containing your custom rules to a container registry](pushing-a-bundle.md) so that you can [enforce its usage with the Snyk CLI](../use-IaC-custom-rules-with-CLI/#to-test-for-a-custom-issue-using-a-bundle-from-a-container-registry)
