# Use IaC custom rules with CLI

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure you followed the steps in [Getting Started with the SDK](../getting-started-with-the-sdk/) to learn how to generate a bundle of your rules.
{% endhint %}

With Snyk IaC, you can test your configuration files from the CLI using your custom rules.&#x20;

There are two ways to use your built bundle:

* [Using a local custom rules bundle](../how-to-run-custom-rules-with-the-snyk-cli/using-a-local-custom-rules-bundle.md), stored in your disk.
* [Using a remote custom rules bundle](../how-to-run-custom-rules-with-the-snyk-cli/using-a-remote-custom-rules-bundle.md), by configuring a remote OCI Registry, in which your custom rules bundle is already stored.&#x20;
