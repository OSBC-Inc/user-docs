# Understanding Linux vulnerability severity

When Snyk determines the severity level (Low, Medium, High, Critical) of a Linux vulnerability for the Snyk Container product, we consider multiple factors:

* Snyk's internal analysis.
* An assessment of the severity provided by the Linux distribution maintainerâ€™s security team.
* The severity of the vulnerability as assessed by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

In certain cases, NVD may assign a different CVSS vector and severity score than the security maintainers of a particular Linux distribution. When this occurs, we prioritize and use the severity as determined by the Linux distribution maintainers as described in our relative importance feature.

## Relative importance

Relative Importance asserts a common severity for a vulnerability and shows the underlying detailed information for that severity, based on multiple sources. This helps developers and analysts view a common level of importance, and exposes the underlying information that helped form the given severity.

## View relative importance

New information appears in the **Security information** section of the project page, for each issue:

![Example for a vulnerability by Ubuntu as Low, and rated by NVD as Critical.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (84).png>)

We currently support relative importance in: Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Amazon Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES). More Linux distributions to follow.

## External information sources

We use the following external sources to provide this information for the distros:
