# Snyk Cloud for Google: API

To onboard a Google Cloud project to Snyk Cloud via the API:

1. [Download an infrastructure as code (IaC) template:](step-1-download-service-account-iac-template-api.md) to give Snyk Cloud permissions to scan your account.
2. [Create a Google service account](step-2-create-the-google-service-account-api.md): using the template you downloaded.
3. [Create and scan a Snyk Cloud Environment.](step-3-create-and-scan-a-snyk-cloud-environment-for-google-api.md)

You can then view the issues Snyk finds. See [Snyk Cloud issues](../../snyk-cloud-issues/).
