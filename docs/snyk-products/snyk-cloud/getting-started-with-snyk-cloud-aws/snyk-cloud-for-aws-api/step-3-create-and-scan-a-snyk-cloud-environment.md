# Step 3: Create and scan a Snyk Cloud Environment (API)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recap**\
You have created the Snyk Cloud IAM role. Now you can create and scan a Snyk Cloud Environment.
{% endhint %}

To send a request to the [Snyk API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2022-12-21%7Ebeta#post-/orgs/-org\_id-/cloud/environments) to create and scan a Snyk Cloud Environment, you must provide the roleâ€™s Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the API request body.

## Find the role ARN

Follow the steps in [Find the role ARN](../snyk-cloud-for-aws-web-ui/step-3-create-and-scan-a-snyk-cloud-environment-web-ui.md#find-the-role-arn), then return here to learn how to send the Snyk API request.

## Send the Snyk API request

After you have the role ARN, send a request to the Snyk API in the format below to create the Snyk Cloud Environment:

```
curl -X POST \
'https://api.snyk.io/rest/orgs/YOUR-ORGANIZATION-ID/cloud/environments?version=2022-12-21~beta' \
-H 'Authorization: token YOUR-API-TOKEN' \
-H 'Content-Type:application/vnd.api+json' -d '{
  "data": {
    "attributes": {
      "kind": "aws",
      "name": "Example AWS Environment",
      "options": {
        "role_arn": "YOUR-ROLE-ARN"
      }
    },
    "type": "environment"
  }
}'
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The example above uses [curl](https://curl.se/), but you can use any API client, such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/).
{% endhint %}

## Understand the API response

The response is a JSON document containing details about your newly created Snyk Cloud Environment; for example:

```json
{
  "jsonapi": {
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "data": {
    "id": "3b7ccff9-8900-4e54-0000-1234abcd1234",
    "type": "environment",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Example AWS Environment",
      "options": {
        "role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/snyk-cloud-role"
      },
      "native_id": "123412341234",
      "properties": {
        "account_id": "123412341234",
        "account_alias": "example"
      },
      "kind": "aws",
      "revision": 1,
      "created_at": "2022-07-31T00:50:49Z",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "updated_at": "2022-07-31T00:50:49Z"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "organization": {
        "data": {
          "id": "d70c1768-5675-0000-1234-abcd1234abcd",
          "type": "organization"
        },
        "links": {
          "related": "/orgs/d70c1768-5675-0000-1234-abcd1234abcd?version=2022-12-21~beta"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Snyk automatically triggers a scan when an environment is created.

Note: the `data.attributes.status` field in the JSON output is set to `in_progress`. This means that Snyk has created your environment and has started scanning it.

## Check if the scan is finished

Optionally, see if the scan is finished by sending another API request in the format below to get environment details. You can find the environment ID in the `data.id` field of the JSON output when you created the environment.

```
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.snyk.io/rest/orgs/YOUR-ORGANIZATION-ID/cloud/environments?id=YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-ID&version=2022-12-21~beta' \
  -H 'Authorization: token YOUR-API-TOKEN'
```

If the `data.attributes.status` field in the JSON output is set to `success`, Snyk has finished scanning your environment.

To re-scan an environment, see [Scan a Snyk Cloud Environment](../../scan-a-snyk-cloud-environment.md).

## What's next?

You can now view misconfiguration issues in the Snyk Web UI. See [Snyk Cloud issues](../../snyk-cloud-issues/) for more information.
