# Managing permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
Our free subscription plan allows you to send up to 200 pending invitations every 7 days, and only has administrator roles. Enterprise plans have administrators and collaborators.\
See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.
{% endhint %}

To edit permissions, you will need the relevant permissions yourself--for example, only group admins can assign other users as group admins.

If your company currently does not have any group admins you will need to ask Snyk [support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) to promote at least one user.

### Changing roles

To change roles for a user:

1. Click on the **Members** tab in the Snyk Web UI (example link: **https://app.snyk.io/org/your-org-name/manage/members**)
2. Find the member to update
3. Update the role for that member, using the dropdown next to role
