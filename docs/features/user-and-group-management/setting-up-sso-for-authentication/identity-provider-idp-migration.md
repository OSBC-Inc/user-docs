# Identity Provider (IdP) migration

When migrating from a legacy IdP to a new IdP, new IdP metadata information must be submitted to Snyk.

To migrate identity providers:

1. Download the correct Worksheet from the [SSO resources](set-up-snyk-single-sign-on-sso.md#resources).
2. Fill out Worksheet with the IdP metadata information
3. Submit Worksheet ([contact our Support team](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) to raise a Support ticket)

To prevent new users from being created within Snyk, youâ€™ll need to maintain your SAML protocol and use both the same Entity ID and ACS URL. If you are changing SAML protocols, [contact our Support team](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new).

After this is done, the Support team will contact you and confirm the updated metadata has granted access through the new IdP.
