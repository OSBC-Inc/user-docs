# Reports

## Introduction

Snyk reports help security and development teams work together. As your coding projects progress, Snyk's reporting dashboard lets security professionals monitor activity and maintain security insight, without looking over developmentâ€™s shoulder.&#x20;

Tracking analytics is simple when all your data can be found in a single screen, on Projects, Issues, Dependencies, and Licenses.

See the [Reports Overview](reports-overview.md) page for more information on organizing and customizing your reports.
