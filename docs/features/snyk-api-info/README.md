# Snyk API

Snyk’s [extensibility and API](https://snyk.io/blog/extensibility-and-the-snyk-api/) enable developers to tune Snyk’s security automation to their specific workflows, ensuring consistency in both developer experience and platform governance.

## Snyk API v1 docs

****[**Snyk v1 API**](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io)****

Snyk is building a new REST API (`https://api.snyk.io/rest`) using the OpenAPI and JSON API standards. Snyk welcomes you to try out the REST API as endpoints are released and development proceeds with the intent of replacing the Snyk v1 API.

### REST API docs

The [**Snyk REST API**](https://apidocs.snyk.io) **** is the new, standards-driven API (OpenAPI, JSON API) now available to all customers.

This new version of the Snyk API represents a major step forward in an evolutionary approach to API development, with each endpoint versioned (see [Versioning](https://apidocs.snyk.io/#overview)).
