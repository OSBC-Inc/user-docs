`config`Manage Snyk CLI configuration

`protect`Applies the patches specified in your `.snyk` file to the local file system

`policy`Display the `.snyk` policy for a package.

`ignore`Modifies the `.snyk` policy to ignore stated issues

`wizard`Configure your policy file to update, auto patch, and ignore vulnerabilities. Snyk wizard updates your `.snyk` file.

`log4shell` Find traces of the Log4J library that are affected by the Log4Shell vulnerability [CVE-2021-44228](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGAPACHELOGGINGLOG4J-2314720). See `snyk log4shell --help` for full instructions.

## OPTIONS

To see command-specific flags and usage, see `help` command, e.g. `snyk container --help`. For advanced usage, we offer language and context-specific flags, listed further down this document.

`--all-projects` (only in `test` and `monitor` commands) Auto-detect all projects in the working directory (including Yarn workspaces)

`--detection-depth=DEPTH` (only in `test` and `monitor` commands) Use with --all-projects or --yarn-workspaces to indicate how many subdirectories to search. `DEPTH` must be a number.\
Default: 4 (the current working directory and 3 sub-directories)

`--exclude=DIRECTORY[,DIRECTORY]...>` (only in `test` and `monitor` commands) Can be used with --all-projects and --yarn-workspaces to indicate sub-directories to exclude. Directories must be comma-separated. If using with `--detection-depth` exclude ignores directories at any level deep.

`--prune-repeated-subdependencies`, `-p` (only in `test` and `monitor` commands) Prune dependency trees, removing duplicate sub-dependencies. Will still find all vulnerabilities, but potentially not all of the vulnerable paths.

`--print-deps` (only in `test` and `monitor` commands) Print the dependency tree before sending it for analysis.

`--remote-repo-url=URL` Set or override the remote URL for the repository that you would like to monitor.

`--dev`Include devDependencies.Default: scan only production dependencies

`--org=ORG_NAME` Specify the ORG\_NAME to run Snyk commands tied to a specific organization. This will influence where will new projects be created after running `monitor` command, some features availability, and private test limits. If you have multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI using:

`$ snyk config set org=ORG_NAME`

Setting a default will ensure all newly monitored projects will be created under your default organization. If you need to override the default, you can use the `--org=ORG_NAME` argument. Default: uses `ORG_NAME` that sets as default in your [Account settings](https://app.snyk.io/account)

`--file=FILE` Sets a package file. When testing locally or monitoring a project, you can specify the file that Snyk should inspect for package information. When omitted Snyk will try to detect the appropriate file for your project.

`--ignore-policy`Ignores all set policies. The current policy in the `.snyk` file, Org level ignores and the project policy on snyk.io.

`--trust-policies`Applies and uses ignore rules from your dependencies' Snyk policies, otherwise ignore policies are only shown as a suggestion.

`--show-vulnerable-paths=none|some|all` Display the dependency paths from the top-level dependencies, down to the vulnerable packages. Doesn't affect output when using JSON `--json` output. Default: some (a few example paths shown) false is an alias for none.

`--project-name=PROJECT_NAME` Specify a custom Snyk project name.

`--target-reference=TARGET_REFERENCE` A reference which differentiates this project. For example, a branch name or version. Projects using the same reference can be used for grouping. Only supported for [Snyk Open Source](../../../snyk-products/snyk-open-source/). For more information, see: [grouping-projects-by-branch-or-version.md](../grouping-projects-by-branch-or-version.md "mention").

`--project-environment=ENVIRONMENT[,ENVIRONMENT]...>` (only in monitor command) Set the project environment to one or more values (comma-separated). To clear the project environment set `--project-environment=`. Allowed values: frontend, backend, internal, external, mobile, saas, onprem, hosted, distributed

`--project-lifecycle=LIFECYCLE[,LIFECYCLE]...>` (only in monitor command) Set the project lifecycle to one or more values (comma-separated). To clear the project lifecycle set `--project-lifecycle=`. Allowed values: production, development, sandbox

`--project-business-criticality=BUSINESS`_`CRITICALITY[,BUSINESS_CRITICALITY]...>` (only in monitor command)_ Set the project business criticality to one or more values (comma-separated). To clear the project business criticality set `--project-business-criticality=`. Allowed values: critical, high, medium, low \_\_

`--project-tags=TAG[,TAG]...>` (only in monitor command). Alias `--tags=TAG[,TAG]...>.` Set the project tags to one or more values (comma-separated key value pairs with an "=" separator). e.g. --project-tags=department=finance,team=alpha. To clear set project tags `--project-tags=`

`--policy-path=PATH_TO_POLICY_FILE` Manually pass a path to a Snyk policy file.

`--json` Prints result in JSON format.

`--json-file-output=OUTPUT_FILE_PATH` (only in `test` command) Save test output in JSON format directly to the specified file, regardless of whether or not you use the `--json` option. This is especially useful if you want to display the human-readable test output via stdout and at the same time save the JSON format output to a file.

`--severity-threshold=low|medium|high|critical` Only report vulnerabilities of provided level or higher.

`--fail-on=all|upgradable|patchable` Only fail when there are vulnerabilities that can be fixed.

**all** - fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be either upgraded or patched.\
**upgradable** - fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be upgraded.\
**patchable** - fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be patched.

If vulnerabilities do not have a fix and this option is being used, tests will pass.

`--dry-run` (only in `protect` command) Don't apply updates or patches during `protect` command run.

`-- [COMPILER_OPTIONS]` Pass extra arguments directly to Gradle or Maven. E.g. `snyk test -- --build-cache`

`|| true` Sets the exit code of the scan to 0. Can be used to continue with a CI/CD pipeline even when there are vulnerabilities.

Below are flags that are influencing CLI behavior for specific projects, languages, and contexts:

### Maven options <a href="#maven-options" id="maven-options"></a>

`--scan-all-unmanaged`Auto-detects maven jar, war, and aar files in a given directory.

**NOTE**

custom-built jar files, even with open source dependencies, are out of scope.

`--scan-unmanaged`Auto-detects maven jar, war, and aar files in a given directory, and individual testing can be done with `--file=FILE_NAME`

`--reachable` (only in `test` and `monitor` commands) Analyze your source code to find which vulnerable functions and packages are called. Cannot be used in conjunction with `--all-projects` or `--all-sub-projects`

`--reachable-timeout=TIMEOUT` The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for Snyk to gather reachability data. If it takes longer than `TIMEOUT`, Reachable Vulnerabilities are not reported. This does not affect regular test or monitor output. Default: 300 (5 minutes).

### Gradle options <a href="#gradle-options" id="gradle-options"></a>

[More information about Gradle CLI options](https://snyk.co/ucT6P)

`--sub-project=NAME`, `--gradle-sub-project=NAME` For Gradle "multi-project" configurations, test a specific sub-project.

`--all-sub-projects` For "multi-project" configurations, test all sub-projects.

`--configuration-matching=CONFIGURATION_REGEX` Resolve dependencies using only configuration(s) that match the provided Java regular expression, e.g. `^releaseRuntimeClasspath$`.

`--configuration-attributes=ATTRIBUTE[,ATTRIBUTE]...` Select certain values of configuration attributes to resolve the dependencies. E.g. `buildtype:release,usage:java-runtime`

### .Net & NuGet options <a href="#net-nuget-options" id="net-nuget-options"></a>

Default: false

### Python options <a href="#python-options" id="python-options"></a>

`--command=COMMAND` Indicate which specific Python commands to use based on the Python version. The default is `python` which executes your system's default python version. Run 'python -V' to find out what version is it. If you are using multiple Python versions, use this parameter to specify the correct Python command for execution. Default: `python` Example: `--command=python3`

`--skip-unresolved=true|false` Allow skipping packages that are not found in the environment.
