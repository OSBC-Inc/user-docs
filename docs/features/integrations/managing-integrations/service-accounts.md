# Service accounts

실제 Snyk 사용자 토큰을 사용하지 않고도 CI(지속적 통합) 및 기타 자동화 용도로 사용할 서비스 계정을 설정할 수 있습니다. 서비스 계정은 연결된 API 토큰만 있는 특수한 시스템 사용자 유형으로 표준 사용자 인증 정보를 대체합니다. 이 토큰을 사용하여 개발 도구와의 통합을 설정하고 CLI 및 API를 사용할 때 Snyk 계정에 액세스하기 위한 인증 정보를 제공합니다. API에 대한 자세한 내용은 [API documentation](../../snyk-api-info/)을 참조하십시오.

You can generate single or multiple tokens on the organization or group levels to manage your integrations. Use group-level tokens to access group API endpoints, organization API endpoints, and the CLI—for all organizations within the group.

Each service account has a unique name associated with it to make it easier to recognize. The name is unique for the organization and cannot be re-used.

By using a service account token, you can:

* Create multiple tokens for different uses or integrations in order to manage each separately
* Ensure seamless integrations even when employees change roles or close their Snyk accounts, for example.

Roles are only for service accounts on the group level, and are only for paid accounts.

Service accounts can be used for GitHub Enterprise integrations. If your team needs to set up a service account in GitHub, it will need to be set up as a GitHub Enterprise integration. GHE is only available though Snyk Enterprise accounts.

## Set up a service account

Generate single or multiple tokens on the organization or group levels to manage your integrations.

### Prerequisites

**Feature availability**\
This feature is available with Enterprise plans. See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.

To create a group service account you must be a group admin. To create an org service account you must be an org admin or a group admin.

This process describes all options.

## How to set up a service account

* Log in to your account and navigate to the relevant group and organization that you want to manage.
* Click on settings ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/cog\_icon.png) > **Service accounts** to view existing service accounts and their details.
* Click **Create a service account** to create a new one. The screen that loads varies a little, depending on if you chose a group (left) or an organization (right):

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/uuid-632ed37e-ed7a-519d-dade-a245a35e6ac6-en.png)

* From the **Service Account** name field, enter a unique name for this token. Remember this name can be used only once for tokens in the same area, either per organization or per group.

* From the **Role** dropdown list, select **Viewer** or **Admin** to configure the scope of the token:
  * Viewer enables read-only access.
  * Admin enables full administrator access.
*   Click **Create**. The token is generated and displayed from the same area, similar to the following:

    Make sure you copy this token as you won’t see it again. You can click **Close and Hide** once you've copied the token; either way, when you navigate away from this page it will no longer be accessible. This is a security standard to keep your tokens safe. The new token is also added to your **Existing service accounts** list, similar to the following image:

* Furthermore, if you created the token for the entire group with an **Admin** role, the token also appears in the **Existing service accounts** list for each of its organizations, though it can only be edited from the **Group** level.

* If you created the token from an organization that is part of a group, the token now also appears in the **Existing service account** list on the group level, where the group admin can also change the token name or even delete it.

* Click any of the links to update the names for a service account token - for Group-level tokens, from the Group level only; for Organization-level tokens, from the relevant organization and also from the Group level:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/uuid-b34e3d10-bb0c-b608-bc08-12f2bf0a4fc0-en.png)

* Repeat these steps to create multiple tokens for the same or any other organization or group.

## Edit and delete a service account

Administrators can change token names and delete tokens. When you delete a service account, the API token associated with it becomes immediately invalidated. When an account is managed with groups, the organization and the group admins can delete tokens for the organization; only group admins can view and manage tokens on the group level. Deleting a service account is the same as revoking the API token.

## How to edit and delete a service account

*   Log in to your account and navigate to the relevant group and organization that you want to manage.

    For group tokens, navigate to the group level. For organization tokens, group admins can delete from either the group or the relevant organization; organization admins should navigate to the relevant organization.
* Click on settings ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/cog\_icon.png) > **Service accounts**.
* Scroll to find the list of existing service accounts:

* From the list of existing tokens:
  * Click **Delete** to delete a token and invalidate it immediately. When prompted, click **OK**. Remember that you cannot re-generate the same token!
  * Click the token name to navigate to change the token name and click **Save**.
