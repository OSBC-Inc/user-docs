# Snyk Broker

Snyk Broker is an open-source tool, that can act as a proxy between Snyk and special integrations including:

* Your Source Code Management (SCM) system on-premise platforms, including [Snyk Code Support](broken-reference).
* Your publicly-accessible Git-based repositories, allowing you to view and control Snyk activity in those repositories for increased data security.
* Your on-premise Jira installation or JFrog Artifactory installation.
* Network restricted [Container Registries](snyk-broker-container-registry-agent/).
* [Infrastructure as code (IaC) configuration](snyk-broker-infrastructure-as-code-detection/) files using Snyk IaC located on private Git-based repositories.

Snyk Broker is an open-source project, hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/snyk/broker), and published as a set of Docker images for specific integrations. See the [Github broker documentation](https://github.com/snyk/broker/blob/master/README.md).
