# IDE tools

IDE integrations allow you to use the functionality of Snyk, all in your standard IDEs (such as Visual Studio).

You can use Snyk with the following pre-built IDEs:

* [eclipse-plugin.md](eclipse-plugin.md "mention")
* [jetbrains-plugins.md](jetbrains-plugins.md "mention")
* [visual-studio-extension.md](visual-studio-extension.md "mention")
* [visual-studio-code-extension-for-snyk-code.md](visual-studio-code-extension-for-snyk-code.md "mention")

You can also build your own IDE integration; see [snyk-ide-plugins](snyk-ide-plugins/ "mention") for details.
