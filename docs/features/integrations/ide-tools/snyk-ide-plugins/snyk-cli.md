# Snyk CLI for IDE plugins

Snyk has OS-specific binaries that are available for download. Sample Java code implementation for downloading the CLI can be found [on the Snyk repository](https://github.com/jenkinsci/snyk-security-scanner-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/io/snyk/jenkins/tools/internal/DownloadService.java).

After the initial installation check weekly for availability of newer CLI versions. Snyk releases updates (features and stability) to the CLI often, so be sure to update frequently.
